# ‚õèÔ∏è Minecraft 2D

This game was originally designed for my 10th grade academic final project, where it utilizes condition statements, looping, variables, graphics, and other programming aspects.

## üìù Features

### Movement

The player's movement can be controlled using `W` or `D` for left and right respectively, while using `Spacebar` for jump.
Collision is detected using pre-defined hitboxes around both the player and each block in the game, making it possible for the player to maneuver, jump over obstacles, and fall landing on a surface.

### Block Placing

Block placement is achieved by detecting the user's mouse position and comparing it relative to the position of the player. The player can only place blocks within a predefined range of the physical player, which is checked when the player attempts to place a block using `Right Click`. The player can also choose from a defined set of different blocks by using the keys `1-9`.

### Block Breaking

Block breaking works similarily to block placing, where the player can only destroy blocks that are within a predefined range from the physical player using `Left Click`.

### Functional TNT

TNT is a well known feature in Mojang's [Minecraft](https://www.minecraft.net/) that has been a part of the game since [Java Edition Classic](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Java_Edition_Classic). In Minecraft 2D, TNT can be placed or destroyed similarily to every other block, but is ignited using `Middle Click`, destroying the blocks around it within a specific range.

### GUI and Instructions

When the game begins, a flat-world is generated, and the player is presented with a graphical user interface with instructions on how the game is played. Although there is no objective, it is designed to be a sandbox game, where it is up to the player's imagination and creativity.
